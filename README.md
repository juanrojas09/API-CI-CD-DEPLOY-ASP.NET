# API-CI-CD-DEPLOY-C-
A small example to apply continuous delivery and continuous integration in a .NET project. Also apply Docker containerization and implement the deployment in RENDER


# Objectives
Create a robust CI/CD workflow using Docker, GitHub Actions, and the Render platform. We will create a Docker image of the API and configure the CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
#Number of instance
In this instance, we will focus solely on creating Docker images and understanding the individual concepts of GitHub Actions. In the next instance, we will deploy using Docker Compose, integrating a MySQL database image and an API backend image.

# Big Picture of flow
